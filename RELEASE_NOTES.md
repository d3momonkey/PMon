- Improved card aspect ratios and text handling
- Enhanced layout consistency across all screen sizes
- Fixed text overflow issues with multi-line content support

### ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements
- Fixed storage data initialization on application startup
- Enhanced monitoring service scheduling for immediate storage data availability
- Improved error handling and safety checks for storage module
- Better mock data structure for testing and development

## Features

### Real-time System Monitoring
- **CPU**: Usage percentage, temperature, core count, and load averages
- **Memory**: RAM usage, available memory, swap usage with visual indicators
- **GPU**: GPU utilization, temperature, memory usage, and vendor information
- **Storage**: Drive information, I/O performance, disk usage without percentages
- **Network**: Traffic monitoring, connection statistics, interface information
- **NPU**: Neural Processing Unit detection and information (if available)
- **Motherboard**: System information, temperatures, and hardware details

### Interface Features
- Modern, responsive dark/light theme design
- Interactive charts with Chart.js integration
- Real-time animated performance graphs
- System tray integration for background monitoring
- Tabbed interface for organized metric viewing
- Responsive grid layout that scales from mobile to 4K displays
