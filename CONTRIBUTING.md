# Contributing to PMon

We love your input! We want to make contributing to PMon as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Coding Style

* Use meaningful variable names
* Follow existing code structure and patterns
* Add comments for complex logic
* Use ES6+ features where appropriate
* Follow the existing CSS methodology

### JavaScript Style Guide

```javascript
// Good
const getUserData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/user');
  return response.json();
};

// Bad
function getData() {
  return fetch('/api/user').then(r => r.json());
}
```

### CSS Style Guide

```css
/* Good - Use BEM methodology */
.metric-card {
  padding: var(--spacing-md);
}

.metric-card__header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.metric-card__header--active {
  background: var(--accent-color);
}

/* Bad - Avoid deep nesting */
.metric-card .header .title.active {
  color: red;
}
```

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/PMon/issues).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Bug Report Template

```markdown
**Description**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

## Feature Requests

We track feature requests using GitHub issues with the `enhancement` label.

**Great Feature Requests** include:

- Clear description of the feature
- Use cases and motivation
- Mockups or examples if applicable
- Discussion of potential implementation approaches

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write integration tests for main features
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error conditions

Example test:
```javascript
describe('CPU Module', () => {
  it('should return CPU usage as a number between 0 and 100', async () => {
    const cpuStats = await cpuModule.getStats();
    expect(cpuStats.usage).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0);
    expect(cpuStats.usage).toBeLessThanOrEqual(100);
  });
});
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add inline comments for complex code
- Update API documentation when changing interfaces
- Include examples in documentation

## Commit Messages

```
feat: add GPU temperature monitoring
fix: resolve memory leak in chart updates
docs: update installation instructions
